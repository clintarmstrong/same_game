I have written hundreds of applets for Google Workspace over the years but this is the first time that I have ever written a game that lives in a Google Sheet!

This game is a clone of a game called SAME GAME that I played as a kid. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by grouping and eliminating large chains of blocks.

You can view the workbook @ the following link. Go to File > Make a Copy. When you open your copy of the workbook, you will need to go to Extensions > Apps Script. Click the Run button at the top, grant permissions, go back to the game workbook and you are ready to play G-SAME-GAME!
